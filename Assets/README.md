"Tech Tools Project"

Made for Accuracy (Internship Apr-June)

This project contains 4 technical tools made to ease efforts of the team at Accuracy.

1) PDF to Text converter: Extracts text from multiple searchable and non-searchable pdf files and stores as text files.
2) PDF Table extractor: Retains the data type and extracts table data from aligned tables. Can extract from multiple pages at once.
3) Word Searcher: Looks for keywords related to certain projects to make analysis efficient. Additonally, plots a graph of common words.
4) AI enabled Text Summariser: Pre-trained BART model to generate text summaries from PDF or Text files.

Advantages:
1) Reduces manual efforts, increases parallelism.
2) No more issues with redundancy.
3) Multiple documents processed in minutes.
4) Makes analysis easier and faster.

Disadvantages:
1) Hardware limitations for folders with more than 5000 files.
2) Takes up CPU due to multithreading.

Status:
Completed programs with adjustments and personalisation.

Dependencies needed:
1) Poppler and saved path
2) Tesseract
